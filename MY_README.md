# Smart contract Management

A smart contract with frontend connectivity using hardhat . In this project I have connected a solidity contract with frontend and added functionalitites to it.

## Description

Here I have added two working functions namely transferOwnership and destroyContract which can triggered whenever called through clicking their erspective button .
Basically we can transferOwnership to some other account using transferOwnership function while if we want to destroy the current contract we can use destroyContract function

Also I have addeed some creativity to the frontend like adding background colors for buton containers and adding borders and margins as well . 

project execution and implementation is explained in the README.md file
