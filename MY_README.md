# Smart contract Management

In this project I have connected a solidity contract with a frontend .

## Description

Here I have added two working functions namely transferOwnership and destroyContract which can triggered whenever called through clicking their erspective button .
Basically we can transferOwnership to some other account using transferOwnership function while if we want to destroy the current contract we can use destroyContract function

project execution and implementation is explained in the README.md file
